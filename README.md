# Cybertek
### A full-stack PHP web application. 
This application was made for an university assignment, but as per usual I had to go above and beyond with the implementation, so I was pretty happy with the results. The platfor is an online shop for high-tech equipement (hence the name). Won't lie that I didn't get the design inspiration from Cyberpunk 2077, which was about to release soon after I submited this work.
